                 into coplanar polar orbits with DE-1 in a highly elliptical orbit and DE-2                            
                 in a lower more circular orbit. The primary objective of the DE program was                           
                 to investigate magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling processes.                                
                The DE mission provided a wealth of new information on a wide variety of magnetospheric

                 spin plane, a 9m tip-to-tip tubular electric antenna deployed along the spacecraft spin                         
                 axis, a short 0.6m electric antenna, mounted on the boom and oriented parallel                        
                 to the long wire antenna, a magnetic loop antenna mounted on the boom and oriented

            The PWI main electronics unit consisted of a Step Frequency Correlator (SFC),                          
             a Low Frequency Correlator (LFC), a Wideband Analog Receiver (WBR) and a Linear                       
             Wave Receiver (LWR).   Only the SFC data are included in these files.  The LFC 
     data were provided in a companion fileset.  A dataset containing available high 
     rate WBR LWR data may be provided in the future.   
                                                   
            The SFC consisted of two Step Frequency Receivers (SFR-A and SFR-B) which provided
    amplitude measurements of the electric and magnetic fields from 100 Hz to 400 kHz 
    and in-phase and quadrature-phase correlations of signals from any selected antenna pair. 
    Phase data are not provided in these datasets.

The following issue values are defined.<br>
(0x2: Attenuation Mode)  If this value is present the measurements are less<br>
sensitive than normal due to the input<br>
being attenuated by 30 dB.  Though<br>
the data are still calibrated they do<br>
not have the same contrast as data<br>
collected in the un-attenuated state.<br>
(0x1: Gain Toggle Mode) If this value is present it means that the SFC was<br>
toggling attenuation states every 1/2<br>
second.  Measurements collected in the<br>
first half of the second are not<br>
attenuated.  Measurements collected in<br>
the last half were attenuated by 30<br>
dB. To achieve a single calibrated<br>
state for a single filter band in a<br>
record the attenuated measurements<br>
have been dropped. The final quality<br>
flag is a bitwise OR'ing of all issue<br>
values.</p>
