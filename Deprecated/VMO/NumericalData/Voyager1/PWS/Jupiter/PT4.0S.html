      This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set            
      (DATA_SET_ID = VG1-J-PWS-2-SA-4.0SEC) previously archived              
      with the PDS.  Changes to this version include the upgrade of          
      the associated labels and templates to PDS version 3                   
      compliance.                                                            
                                                                             
                                                                             
    Data Set Description                                                     
    --------------------                                                     
      This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric               
      field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver              
      spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian               
      magnetosphere.  For each 4-second interval, a field strength           
      is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels            
      whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                   
      kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency,           
      four channels per decade.  The time associated with each set           
      of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning of           
      the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second spectra            
      are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps           
      are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or           
      more channels are missing within a scan, the missing                   
      measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not                 
      calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted          
      in raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis               
      since they are roughly proportional to the log of the                  
      electric field strength.  Calibration procedures and tables            
      are provided for use with this data set; the use of these is           
      described below.                                                       
                                                                             
                                                                             
    Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                    
    -------------------------------------                                    
      The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text            
      file named VG1PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-1).  This provides                
      information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output           
      of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna          
      voltages for each frequency channel.  Following is a brief             
      description of these files and a tutorial in their                     
      application.                                                           
                                                                             
      Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The             
      columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02, ICHAN03, ICHAN04,          
      ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                                         
                                                                             
      The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed            
      by the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of             
      the 16 frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each          
      line contains calibrations for successive data number values           
      ranging from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually                   
      represents the lack of data since the baseline noise values            
      for each channel are all above that.)                                  
                                                                             
      A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a          
      data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to             
      obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and             
      frequency channel.  For example, the following VAX FORTRAN             
      code may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1             
      PWS:                                                                   
                                                                             
      real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                  
      open ( unit=10, file='VG1PWSCL.TAB', status='old' )                    
                                                                             
      do i=0,255                                                             
        read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                           
      end do                                                                 
      close (10)                                                             
                                                                             
      Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency           
      channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage            
      would be given by the following array reference:                       
                                                                             
      volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                               
                                                                             
      This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by            
      dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.            
      That is:                                                               
                                                                             
      efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                        
                                                                             
      Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square          
      of the electric field value by the nominal frequency                   
      bandwidth of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.              
                                                                             
      specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                 
                                                                             
      Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral           
      density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                        
                                                                             
      pwrflux = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73           
                                                                             
      Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                
      efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration            
      table directly.                                                        
                                                                             
      The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum

      The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text            
      file named VG1PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-1).  This provides                
      information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output           
      of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna          
      voltages for each frequency channel.  Following is a brief             
      description of these files and a tutorial in their                     
      application.

      The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed            
      by the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of             
      the 16 frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each          
      line contains calibrations for successive data number values           
      ranging from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually                   
      represents the lack of data since the baseline noise values            
      for each channel are all above that.)                                  
                                                                             
      A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a          
      data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to             
      obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and             
      frequency channel.  For example, the following VAX FORTRAN             
      code may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1             
      PWS:                                                                   
                                                                             
      real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                  
      open ( unit=10, file='VG1PWSCL.TAB', status='old' )                    
                                                                             
      do i=0,255                                                             
        read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                           
      end do                                                                 
      close (10)                                                             
                                                                             
      Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency           
      channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage            
      would be given by the following array reference:                       
                                                                             
      volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                               
                                                                             
      This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by            
      dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.            
      That is:                                                               
                                                                             
      efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                        
                                                                             
      Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square          
      of the electric field value by the nominal frequency                   
      bandwidth of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.              
                                                                             
      specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                 
                                                                             
      Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral           
      density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                        
                                                                             
      pwrflux = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73           
                                                                             
      Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                
      efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration            
      table directly.                                                        
                                                                             
      The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum             
      analyzer channel for each Voyager spacecraft are given below:

<pre><code>Version 1.1                                                              
-----------                                                              
  This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set            
  (DATA_SET_ID = VG1-J-PWS-2-SA-4.0SEC) previously archived              
  with the PDS.  Changes to this version include the upgrade of          
  the associated labels and templates to PDS version 3                   
  compliance.                                                            
                                                                         
                                                                         
Data Set Description                                                     
--------------------                                                     
  This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric               
  field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver              
  spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian               
  magnetosphere.  For each 4-second interval, a field strength           
  is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels            
  whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                   
  kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency,           
  four channels per decade.  The time associated with each set           
  of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning of           
  the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second spectra            
  are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps           
  are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or           
  more channels are missing within a scan, the missing                   
  measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not                 
  calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted          
  in raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis               
  since they are roughly proportional to the log of the                  
  electric field strength.  Calibration procedures and tables            
  are provided for use with this data set; the use of these is           
  described below.                                                       
                                                                         
                                                                         
Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                    
-------------------------------------                                    
  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text            
  file named VG1PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-1).  This provides                
  information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output           
  of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna          
  voltages for each frequency channel.  Following is a brief             
  description of these files and a tutorial in their                     
  application.                                                           
                                                                         
  Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The             
  columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02, ICHAN03, ICHAN04,          
  ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                                         
                                                                         
  The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed            
  by the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of             
  the 16 frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each          
  line contains calibrations for successive data number values           
  ranging from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually                   
  represents the lack of data since the baseline noise values            
  for each channel are all above that.)                                  
                                                                         
  A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a          
  data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to             
  obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and             
  frequency channel.  For example, the following VAX FORTRAN             
  code may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1             
  PWS:                                                                   
                                                                         
  real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                  
  open ( unit=10, file='VG1PWSCL.TAB', status='old' )                    
                                                                         
  do i=0,255                                                             
    read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                           
  end do                                                                 
  close (10)                                                             
                                                                         
  Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency           
  channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage            
  would be given by the following array reference:                       
                                                                         
  volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                               
                                                                         
  This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by            
  dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.            
  That is:                                                               
                                                                         
  efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                        
                                                                         
  Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square          
  of the electric field value by the nominal frequency                   
  bandwidth of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.              
                                                                         
  specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                 
                                                                         
  Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral           
  density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                        
                                                                         
  pwrflux = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73           
                                                                         
  Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                
  efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration            
  table directly.                                                        
                                                                         
  The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum             
  analyzer channel for each Voyager spacecraft are given below:

  This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set            
  (DATA_SET_ID = VG1-J-PWS-2-SA-4.0SEC) previously archived              
  with the PDS.  Changes to this version include the upgrade of          
  the associated labels and templates to PDS version 3                   
  compliance.                                                            
                                                                         
                                                                         
Data Set Description                                                     
--------------------                                                     
  This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric               
  field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver              
  spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian               
  magnetosphere.  For each 4-second interval, a field strength           
  is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels            
  whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                   
  kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency,           
  four channels per decade.  The time associated with each set           
  of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning of           
  the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second spectra            
  are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps           
  are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or           
  more channels are missing within a scan, the missing                   
  measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not                 
  calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted          
  in raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis               
  since they are roughly proportional to the log of the                  
  electric field strength.  Calibration procedures and tables            
  are provided for use with this data set; the use of these is           
  described below.                                                       
                                                                         
                                                                         
Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                    
-------------------------------------                                    
  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text            
  file named VG1PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-1).  This provides                
  information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output           
  of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna          
  voltages for each frequency channel.  Following is a brief             
  description of these files and a tutorial in their                     
  application.                                                           
                                                                         
  Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The             
  columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02, ICHAN03, ICHAN04,          
  ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                                         
                                                                         
  The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed            
  by the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of             
  the 16 frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each          
  line contains calibrations for successive data number values           
  ranging from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually                   
  represents the lack of data since the baseline noise values            
  for each channel are all above that.)                                  
                                                                         
  A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a          
  data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to             
  obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and             
  frequency channel.  For example, the following VAX FORTRAN             
  code may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1             
  PWS:                                                                   
                                                                         
  real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                  
  open ( unit=10, file='VG1PWSCL.TAB', status='old' )                    
                                                                         
  do i=0,255                                                             
    read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                           
  end do                                                                 
  close (10)                                                             
                                                                         
  Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency           
  channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage            
  would be given by the following array reference:                       
                                                                         
  volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                               
                                                                         
  This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by            
  dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.            
  That is:                                                               
                                                                         
  efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                        
                                                                         
  Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square          
  of the electric field value by the nominal frequency                   
  bandwidth of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.              
                                                                         
  specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                 
                                                                         
  Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral           
  density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                        
                                                                         
  pwrflux = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73           
                                                                         
  Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                
  efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration            
  table directly.                                                        
                                                                         
  The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum             
  analyzer channel for each Voyager spacecraft are given below:
