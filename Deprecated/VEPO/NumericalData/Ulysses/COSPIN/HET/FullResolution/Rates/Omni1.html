 		"description": "
           A directory containing daily ftp-downloadable files containing readout-by-readout listings of 
           the counts accumulated in the H1-H9 spin-averaged counting rates. These counting rates respond 
           primarily to protons (H1-H5, H9) in the approximate energy ranges 5.4-14, 14-19, 24-31, 34-68,
           68-92, and &gt;92 MeV, respectively, and to electrons (H6-8) in the very approximate energy ranges 
           1-3, 5-10, and 3-5 MeV, respectively.
           The naming convention for the daily files is uly_het_full_rat_omni1_YYYDDD.txt, where YYY 
           indicates the three-digit year since 1900 (e.g. YYY=090 for 1990, and YYY=102 for 2002) and 
           DDD indicates the three digit day of year (Jan. 1 = 1).
           In each file, following a detailed description of the format, the data consist of a
           listing of counts accumulated in the H1-H9 spin-averaged counting  rates during the intervals 
           between successive readouts, organized into columns as described below.
           The first 4 columns give the start time of the counting rate accumulation period as
           fractional year (to 12 decimal places) and as  year since 1900, day of year, and ms
           of day at the start of the accumulation, followed by 1 column giving the duration of
           the accumulation period in milli-seconds (it is the same for all 9 rates), and 9
           columns giving the counts accumulated in that period for each rate.  All fields
           except for the fractional year are in integer format.
           Each line contains data for one single readout of the rates H1-H9, and all readouts
           where at least one of the rates has a non-fill value are included.  Where fill
           does occur it is indicated by -1.
           Since the accumulation period for each readout is forced to include an integral number
           of spacecraft spins in order to produce pure spin-averaged measurements, the lengths of
           the accumulation periods vary in a cyclic manner as the period of the telemetry cycle
           beats with the spacecraft spin period.  All counting rates in this file are read out
           twice per spacecraft format.  At the most common science telemetry bit rate (2048 bps)
           this corresponds to an average interval between readouts of 16 seconds.  Thus, with a
           typical 5 rpm spacecraft spin rate the accumulation intervals vary in a repeating cycle of
           12, 12, 24, 12, 12, 24, 12, etc. seconds.  At lower bit rates the average interval is
           equal to 16x(2048/BR) seconds and the cycle automatically adjusts to produce this average
           accumulation.
           No noise-removal or despiking has been done, so caution must be used in interpreting isolated 
           large increases or decreases in the counting rates.

</dd><dl><dt>Caveats</dt><dd>
           Heavier nuclei with similar penetrating power to 68-92 MeV protons also produce counts 
           in H5.  However the intensities of such heavier nuclei are usually much lower than the proton
           intensity.  The most significant contributor to such contamination is usually helium.  Electrons
           produced by the RTG gammas are excluded by the coincidence requirement, which requires greater

           may in some circumstances make significant contributions to the counting rate.
           During In-Flight-Calibrate (IFC) sequences, two ramps of pulse are fed to the detector 
           amplifiers over several hours.  For part of each sequence, the pulses satisfy the H5 counting
           rate logic.  The H5 counting rate responds to those pulses that are so small that they do not 
           trigger the high level discriminators on the detectors.  This leads to two small spikes separated 
           by several hours (depending on bit rate) in the H5 counting rate.  A clear example of this effect 
           (and of the corresponding effect on H12, which counts the larger pulses) can be found on day 31 
           of 1991.

at the time defined in columns 1-4.  The H9 counting rate normally responds primarily to<br>
protons with energies greater than ~92 MeV, which completely penetrate the telescope<br>
detector stack.  Thus it provides a measure of the integral intensity of energetic charged<br>
particles with penetrating power equal or greater to that of 92 MeV protons.</p>
</dd><dl><dt>Caveats</dt><dd>
           Because of proximity of the low-level discriminators on several of the detectors to the
           expected energy deposits by minimum ionizing protons, the efficiency of detection decreases
           somewhat for minimum ionizing particles.  Because of the dependence of the detector noise
           on temperature, the decrease in efficiency depends to some extent on the telescope 
           temperature.  
           Since the particles that trigger H9 completely penetrate the telescope, both forward and 
           backward-going particles are counted.  Backward-going particles must also penetrate the
           spacecraft structure and instruments behind the HET before entering the telescope, so 
           the energy threshold for backward-going particles is very poorly known.  Thus this 
           counting rate is more suitable for study of relative variations in the particle intensity 
           than for derivation of an accurate integral flux.
