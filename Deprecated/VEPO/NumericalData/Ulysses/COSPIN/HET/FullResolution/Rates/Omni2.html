           A directory containing daily ftp-downloadable files containing readout-by-readout listings of
           the counts accumulated in the H1-H27 spin-averaged counting rates.  The rates H10-H13 are 
           coincidence counting rates corresponding primarily to heavy nuclei (Z&gt;2) with penetrating
           power equivalent to carbon-12 nuclei in the approximate energy ranges 26-36, 44-127, 127-173,
           and &gt;173 MeV/nucleon, resspectively.
           H14-H27 are single detector counting rates giving, in order,  the total number of counts 
           above the lowest level discriminator thresholds of detectors D1-D6, K1-K6 (or D7-D12), 
           A (or D13), and the anti-coincidence scintillator S.  The single detector counting rates 
           are provided simply to assess the health of the detectors and are of little use 
           scientifically.
           The naming convention for the daily files is uly_het_full_rat_omni2_YYYDDD.txt, where YYY 
           indicates the three-digit year since 1900 (e.g. YYY=090 for 1990, and YYY=102 for 2002) and 
           DDD indicates the three digit day of year (Jan. 1 = 1). 
           In each file, following a detailed description of the format, the data consist of a listing 
           of counts accumulated in the H10-H27 spin-averaged counting rates during the intervals
           between successive readouts, organized into columns as described below.
           The first 4 columns give the start time of the counting rate accumulation period as 
           fractional year (to 12 decimal places) and as  year since 1900, day of year, and ms 
           of day at the start of the accumulation, followed by 1 column giving the duration of 
           the accumulation period in milli-seconds (it is the same for all rates except H13, 
           which is read out twice in each accumulation period, and is thus represented as
           H13a and H13b - see below and embedded documentation in each daily file), and 19 
           columns giving the counts accumulated in that period for each rate.  All fields 
           except for the fractional year are in integer format.  The start time for H13a is
           the time given  as the start time for the line, but (to sufficient accuracy) its 
           accumulation period is half the period given under "coverage".  Again, to sufficient 
           accuracy, the start time for H13b is the time given plus half the accumulation period, 
           and the accumulation period for H13b is half the period given under "coverage".
           Each line contains data for one single readout of the rates H10-H12, H13a,
           H13b, and H14-H27.  All readouts where at least one of the rates has a non-fill value 
           are included.  Where fill does occur it is indicated by -1. 
           Since the accumulation period for each readout is forced to include an integral number 
           of spacecraft spins in order to produce pure spin-averaged measurements, the lengths of 
           the accumulation periods vary in a cyclic manner as the period of the telemetry cycle 
           beats with the spacecraft spin period.  At the most common science telemetry rate, 
           2048 bps, each rate in this file is read out on average once every 128 seconds, except for 
           H13 which is readout on average twice in every 128 seconds.  At 2048 bps, the cycle of
           accumulation periods is 132, 132, 120, 132, 132,, 120, 132, ... seconds.
           No noise-removal or despiking has been done, so caution must be used in
           interpreting isolated large increases or decreases in the counting rates.

columns giving the counts accumulated in that period for each rate.  All fields<br>
except for the fractional year are in integer format.  The start time for H13a is<br>

           The energy range given below is appropriate only for Carbon-12 nuclei.
           The H12 counting rate has a bit rate dependence which is not fully understood.  It is 
           most clear during solar particle events when the H12 rate is elevated above its normally 
           very low background rate.  
           Also, during In-Flight-Calibrate (IFC) sequences, which over several hours (depending on
           telemetry bit rate) feed two ramps of pulses to the detector amplifiers, the H12 counts 
           counts all of the IFC pulses that have sufficient amplitude to exceed the high level 
           discriminators used to exclude protons and helium from being counted by H12.  Most of 
           the IFC pulses do exceed the levels necessary to trigger these discriminators, so that 
           the H12 counting rate is dramatically elevated for a period of several hours when the 
           IFC sequence is performed.
           A particularly clear example of both effects can be found in days 83-86 of 1991, when
           an IFC sequence is performed on day 86 in the tail of a solar particle event that began
           at the very end of day 83.
	   As a result of these effects, the H12 counting rate should not be used to determine
           accurate particle flux levels.

The H13a counting rate normally responds primarily to nuclei with Z&gt;2 with penetrating<br>
power equivalent to Carbon-12 nuclei with energies greater than 173 MeV/n.  Such nuclei<br>
completely penetrate the telescope.  Therefore, the H13 is also sensitive, above a poorly<br>
known energy threshold, to nuclei going backward through the HET after penetrating the<br>
spacecraft structures and other instruments that lie behind the HET on the spacecraft.<br>
Protons, helium nuclei, and electrons are excluded by discriminators requiring an<br>
energy deposit in  at least one detector greater than can be produced by a Z=2 nucleus.</p>
