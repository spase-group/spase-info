 		"description": "A Directory containing Daily FTP downloadable Files containing Readout-by-Readout Listings of the Counts accumulated in the H1-H9 Spin-Averaged Counting Rates. These Counting Rates respond primarily to Protons (H1-H5, H9) in the approximate Energy Ranges 5.4-14, 14-19, 24-31, 34-68, 68-92, and &gt;92 MeV, respectively, and to Electrons (H6-8) in the very approximate Energy Ranges 1-3, 5-10, and 3-5 MeV, respectively. The Naming Convention for the Daily Files is uly_het_full_rat_omni1_YYYDDD.txt, where YYY indicates the three digit Year since 1900 (e.g. YYY=090 for 1990, and YYY=102 for 2002) and DDD indicates the three digit Day of Year (January 1 = 1). In each File, following a detailed Description of the Format, the Data consist of a Listing of Counts accumulated in the H1-H9 Spin-Averaged Counting Rates during the Intervals between successive Readouts, organized into Columns as described below. The first four Columns give the Start Time of the Counting Rate Accumulation Period as Fractional Year (to 12 Decimal Places) and as Year since 1900, Day of Year, and Milliseconds of Day at the Start of the Accumulation, followed by one Column giving the Duration of the Accumulation Period in Milliseconds (it is the same for all nine Rates), and nine Columns giving the Counts accumulated in that Period for each Rate. All Fields except for the Fractional Year are in Integer Format. Each Line contains Data for one single Readout of the Rates H1-H9, and all Readouts where at least one of the Rates has a Non-fill Value are included. Where Fill does occur it is indicated by -1. Since the Accumulation Period for each Readout is forced to include an Integral Number of Spacecraft Spins in order to produce pure Spin-Averaged Measurements, the Lengths of the Accumulation Periods vary in a Cyclic Manner as the Period of the Telemetry Cycle beats with the Spacecraft Spin Period. All Counting Rates in this File are read out twice per Spacecraft Format. At the most common Science Telemetry Bit Rate (2048 bps) this corresponds to an Average Interval between Readouts of 16 s. Thus, with a typical 5 rpm Spacecraft Spin Rate the Accumulation Intervals vary in a repeating Cycle of 12, 12, 24, 12, 12, 24, 12, etc., seconds. At lower Bit Rates the Average Interval is equal to 16 times (2048/BR) seconds and the Cycle automatically adjusts to produce this Average Accumulation. No Noise Removal or Despiking has been done, so Caution must be used in interpreting isolated large Increases or Decreases in the Counting Rates.",

However Higher Energy Electrons of Cosmic Ray, Solar, Magnetospheric or other natural Origin may in some Circumstances make significant Contributions to the Counting Rate. During In-Flight-Calibrate (IFC) Sequences, two Ramps of Pulse are fed to the Detector Amplifiers over several Hours. For Part of each Sequence, the Pulses satisfy the H5 Counting Rate Logic. The H5 Counting Rate responds to those Pulses that are so small that they do not trigger the High Level Discriminators on the Detectors. This leads to two small Spikes separated by several Hours (depending on Bit Rate) in the H5 Counting Rate. A clear Example of this Effect (and of the corresponding Effect on H12, which Counts the larger Pulses) can be found on Day 31 of 1991.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Cadence</dt><dd>PT12S</dd></dl><dl><dt>FillValue</dt><dd>-1</dd></dl><dl><dt>Particle</dt><dd><dl><dt>ParticleType</dt><dd>Proton</dd></dl><dl><dt>ParticleQuantity</dt><dd>Counts</dd></dl><dl><dt>EnergyRange</dt><dd><dl><dt>Low</dt><dd>68</dd></dl><dl><dt>High</dt><dd>92</dd></dl><dl><dt>Units</dt><dd>MeV</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><dl><dt class="parameter">Parameter #8</dt><dd><dl><dt>Name</dt><dd>COSPIN/HET H06</dd></dl><dl><dt>ParameterKey</dt><dd>Column_11</dd></dl><dt>Description</dt><dd><p>Counts accumulated by Counting Rate H6 during the Period of Coverage (Column 5) starting at the Time defined in Columns 1-4.

The H9 Counting Rate normally responds primarily to Protons with Energies greater than about 92 MeV, which completely penetrate the Telescope Detector Stack. Thus it provides a Measure of the Integral Intensity of Energetic Charged Particles with Penetrating Power equal or greater to that of 92 MeV Protons.</p>
</dd><dl><dt>Caveats</dt><dd>Because of Proximity of the Low Level Discriminators on several of the Detectors to the expected Energy Deposits by Minimum Ionizing Protons, the Efficiency of Detection decreases somewhat for Minimum Ionizing Particles. Because of the Dependence of the Detector Noise on Temperature, the Decrease in Efficiency depends to some extent on the Telescope Temperature. Since the Particles that trigger H9 completely penetrate the Telescope, both Forward and Backward-going Particles are counted. Backward-going Particles must also penetrate the Spacecraft Structure and Instruments behind the HET before entering the Telescope, so the Energy Threshold for Backward-going Particles is very poorly known. Thus this Counting Rate is more suitable for Study of relative Variations in the Particle Intensity than for Derivation of an accurate Integral Flux.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Cadence</dt><dd>PT12S</dd></dl><dl><dt>FillValue</dt><dd>-1</dd></dl><dl><dt>Particle</dt><dd><dl><dt>ParticleType</dt><dd>Electron</dd></dl><dl><dt>ParticleQuantity</dt><dd>Counts</dd></dl><dl><dt>EnergyRange</dt><dd><dl><dt>Low</dt><dd>92</dd></dl><dl><dt>High</dt><dd>1.0E+14</dd></dl><dl><dt>Units</dt><dd>MeV</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></body></html>
